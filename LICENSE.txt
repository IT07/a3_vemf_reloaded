================================================================================================
What does this mean for me?

	You are able to share VEMF under any format, torrents, file hosts, ftp etc,
however it must be free to be able to access the downloads. If you have to pay
for an account to access the download link you are in violation of the license.

	You can adapt the work as you please inside of the terms of the license.
	
	If you want to release an adapted version of VEMF, you must give appropriate
credit to the original authors, provide a link to the license, indicate if changes
were made (via a changelog), and share the new version under the same license.

	You must do this in a way that does not indicate that the original authors
endorses you or your use. (An example would be advertising your new adaptation
as originally coming from VEMF. The key being "Advertise" instead of simply listing it.)

	Finally, this content cannot be commercialized. If you are receiving ANY
monetary funds where VEMF is included in your work, you are breaking the terms of this license.
Donations are to be given without any return consideration. The person donating cannot have
the intention of receiving something in return from you for making their donation.

This include but is not limited to:
 - Selling access to a server that runs VEMF.
 - Allowing users of your server to purchase "perks" somehow related to VEMF. (Mission GPS?)
 - Including VEMF in a mod that is being sold for a profit.
 - Preventing access to VEMF files or content based on donations.
 
================================================================================================
So do I need to ask for your permission to modify VEMF?

	As a non-binding request, I ask that you make a concerted effort to try to contact me
to ask for my permission before you start modifying VEMF. I would like to know about modified
versions of VEMF before they are released. This request does not apply to individuals
("Individuals" not "groups") or "clans" that wish to modify VEMF for their individual server.

	Even though this license seems a little overkill, I'm a fairly likeable guy. If you're
trying to contact me for a non-commercial interest, I'll most likely allow it.

	If you cannot reach me within a month, and you meet all the other requirements of this license,
you can modify VEMF freely within the terms of the license.

================================================================================================
I feel VEMF is infringing upon my work.

	If you think VEMF infringes upon your work, please contact me.
